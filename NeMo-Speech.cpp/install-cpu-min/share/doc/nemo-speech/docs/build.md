# Build from source

Published binaries are the shortest path to a working CLI. Build from source
when developing the runtime, enabling optional components, or targeting a
platform without a suitable release artifact.

## Requirements

- Git;
- CMake 3.26 or newer and Ninja;
- C and C++17 compilers (GCC 13 or newer on Linux); and
- the toolkit required by the selected GPU backend.

CUDA 12 and 13 are supported. gRPC builds additionally need compatible gRPC,
Protobuf compiler/runtime, and Abseil development packages from a mutually
compatible package set.

### Install the basic tools

Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build git pkg-config
```

Fedora/RHEL-family:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ cmake ninja-build git pkgconf-pkg-config
```

macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
xcode-select --install  # skip if the Command Line Tools are already installed
brew install cmake ninja
```

Windows from an elevated PowerShell with Chocolatey:

```powershell
choco install -y git cmake ninja visualstudio2022-workload-vctools
```

Confirm that `cmake --version` reports 3.26 or newer. Distribution repositories
that ship an older CMake require a newer package before configuration. CUDA,
Vulkan, Metal, gRPC, and optional language frontend dependencies are installed
only when selecting those features; see the platform sections below.

## Prepare the checkout

Initialize the submodules needed by the selected components:

```bash
git submodule update --init ggml
git submodule update --init third_party/cpp-httplib  # HTTP server only
git submodule update --init llama.cpp                # NMT only
git submodule update --init proto/riva-common        # gRPC only
```

`scripts/configure.sh` checks required submodules before CMake runs. CUDA
presets also apply the pinned patches from `ggml-patches/` in order.

## Configure and build

Use a supported preset:

```bash
scripts/configure.sh cuda-asr
cmake --build --preset cuda-asr
```

Presets follow `<backend>-<component>` for the `cpu`, `cuda`, `metal`, and
`vulkan` backends and the `asr`, `diar`, `tts`, `nmt`, `speech`, and `server`
component sets. Run `cmake --list-presets` for the exhaustive list. A few useful
landmarks are:

| Preset | Components |
|---|---|
| `cpu-asr` | CPU ASR and diarization |
| `cuda-speech` | CUDA ASR, diarization, NMT, and TTS |
| `metal-nmt` | Metal-enabled NMT build |
| `vulkan-diar` | Vulkan standalone diarization build |
| `<backend>-server` | ASR, diarization, TTS, HTTP API, realtime WebSocket, and playground |
| `cuda-full` | CUDA server plus normalization, Flashlight, and language frontends |
| `developer` | CPU speech components plus HTTP, gRPC, examples, tests, and tools |

The `<backend>-server` presets are what the source installer uses. They do not
pull in NMT, protobuf, or gRPC. Use `cuda-full`, `developer`, or explicit CMake options when
those features and the separate `riva_server` executable are needed.

The preset selects which components and ggml backend are compiled.

Additional CMake definitions can follow the preset:

```bash
scripts/configure.sh cuda-server -DNEMO_SPEECH_WITH_NORM=ON
cmake --build --preset cuda-server
```

For a manual configuration, explicitly disable the patched CUDA paths when
building against stock ggml:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DGGML_CUDA=ON \
  -DNEMO_SPEECH_GGML_PATCHED=OFF
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
```

See [ggml patches](development/ggml-patches.md) for the patched and stock
runtime tradeoffs.

## Components

| CMake option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_ASR` | ON | ASR runtime, C ABI, and CLI |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_DIAR` | ON | Standalone and ASR-integrated diarization |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_TTS` | ON | TTS runtime, C ABI, and CLI |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_NMT` | OFF | NMT through llama.cpp |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_CLI` | ON | Unified `nemo-speech` executable |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_HTTP` | OFF | HTTP, realtime WebSocket, and playground |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_GRPC` | OFF | Riva-compatible gRPC adapters |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | OFF | Public in-process C ABI examples |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_TESTS` | OFF | First-party correctness tests |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_BUILD_TOOLS` | OFF | Developer diagnostics and microbenchmarks |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_WITH_FLASHLIGHT` | OFF | Flashlight and dynamically linked KenLM decoding |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_WITH_NORM` | OFF | Sparrowhawk/OpenFST text normalization |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_TTS_WITH_JA` | OFF | Japanese TTS text frontend |
| `NEMO_SPEECH_TTS_WITH_ZH` | OFF | Mandarin TTS text frontend |

Component builds initialize and link only their required optional dependencies.
Japanese and Mandarin tokenizer dependencies remain disabled unless their
frontends are selected.

## Optional dependencies

The HTTP server uses the `third_party/cpp-httplib` submodule and OpenSSL for
optional TLS. CLI-only builds require neither dependency.

Flashlight decoding requires the `third_party/flashlight-text` and
`third_party/kenlm` submodules. KenLM is built as a replaceable dynamic library
(`libkenlm` or `kenlm.dll`).

ITN and TN dependencies install into a project-local prefix without `sudo`:

```bash
scripts/build_itn_deps.sh
```

When combining normalization with Flashlight on Linux, build the private static
SentencePiece dependency as well:

```bash
scripts/build_sentencepiece_static.sh
```

See the component model and configuration guides for runtime companion assets.

## Install the SDK

For native C/C++ integration, install the SDK into a staging prefix. Another
CMake project can then consume its public headers, runtime libraries, and
exported targets without referencing the NeMo-Speech.cpp source tree:

```bash
cmake --install build/cuda-asr --prefix "$PWD/install"
cmake -S my-app -B my-app/build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/install"
cmake --build my-app/build
```

The prefix includes the CLI, selected runtime libraries, stable C headers,
CMake targets, documentation, configuration examples, and applicable license
notices. See [Native SDK integration](sdk.md) for consuming the package.

## Windows

Native Windows builds use Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools. `cl.exe` is the CUDA
host compiler on x64; ARM64 uses `clang-cl`. The build driver handles backend,
vcpkg, and patch setup:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build.ps1 -Backend cuda -Http
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build.ps1 -Backend vulkan -Http
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build.ps1 -Backend cpu -Flashlight
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build.ps1 -Backend cpu -AsrOnly
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\windows\build.ps1 -Backend cpu -Grpc
```

See [Windows builds](development/windows-build.md) for prerequisites and backend
notes.

## Containers

`docker/Dockerfile` provides a minimal `runtime` target and a `builder`
target containing the toolchain and sources:

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -f docker/Dockerfile --target runtime \
  -t nemo-speech-runtime:x86_64 .

docker run --gpus all -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$PWD/models:/models:ro" nemo-speech-runtime:x86_64 \
  serve --host 0.0.0.0 --config /models/server.yaml
```

The runtime image entry point is `nemo-speech`; models remain outside the
image. HTTP, gRPC, Flashlight, normalization, NMT, and TTS language frontends
are controlled by Docker build arguments documented in the Dockerfile.

## Build outputs

Selected artifacts are written under the configured build directory's `bin/`:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `nemo-speech` | Unified CLI and optional HTTP/WebSocket host |
| `riva_server` | Optional Riva-compatible gRPC server |
| `libnemo_speech_asr`, `libnemo_speech_asr_c` | ASR/diarization runtime and public C ABI |
| `libnemo_speech_tts` | TTS runtime and public C ABI |
| `libnemo_speech_nmt`, `libnemo_speech_nmt_c` | Optional NMT runtime and public C ABI |
| `libkenlm` / `kenlm.dll` | Optional dynamically linked language-model runtime |
| `transcribe_file`, `diarize_file` | Native ASR and diarization examples |
| `translate_text`, `synthesize_text` | Native NMT and TTS examples |

Tests and developer tools are emitted only when their corresponding build
options are enabled.
