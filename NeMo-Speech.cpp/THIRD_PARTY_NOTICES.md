# Third-Party Notices

This file covers third-party source and data incorporated into or modified by
the NeMo-Speech.cpp source tree. The Git submodule revisions are pinned by
the repository's gitlinks. Their upstream notices remain in the submodule
checkouts and are summarized here.

### OpenSSL

- Source: [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
- Copyright The OpenSSL Project Authors and other contributors
- License: Apache License 2.0

OpenSSL is dynamically linked only when optional HTTP-server TLS is enabled. It
is not incorporated into the source tree. The default container disables HTTP
TLS, links gRPC's unsecure libraries, and does not distribute OpenSSL.
Distributions that enable HTTP TLS must include the applicable OpenSSL
attribution and Apache 2.0 terms.

### Container system libraries

The Linux container copies the shared libraries required by its executables
from the CUDA/Ubuntu builder into a `FROM scratch` runtime. This includes the
GNU C Library, GCC runtime libraries, c-ares, zlib, bzip2, and XZ Utils/liblzma,
subject to the exact feature set and package revisions in the built image.

The container records the package copyright file for every copied
Debian/Ubuntu shared library under
`/opt/nemo-speech/share/licenses/nemo-speech/third_party/system/`. The complete
project notice set is installed under
`/opt/nemo-speech/share/licenses/nemo-speech/`.

## NVIDIA ggml patches

The `ggml-patches/` directory contains NVIDIA-authored changes applied to the
pinned MIT-licensed ggml source. New source files created by those patches
carry the NVIDIA Apache-2.0 header; existing ggml files retain their upstream
notices. The resulting combined source and binaries retain ggml's MIT notice.
